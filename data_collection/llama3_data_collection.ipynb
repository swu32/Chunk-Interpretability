    "prompt_frequent_words_train = \"In today’s world, people often feel the push and pull of connection and solitude. With technology and social media on the rise, we now have countless ways to stay in touch with those we know and love. However, the question of whether this digital world can truly satisfy our need for real connection remains. To be truly connected is to share experiences, to understand and to be understood. This kind of connection goes far beyond a screen. The desire to connect is universal, and people have searched for it throughout history. In ancient times, communities formed to support one another, to live together, and to build bonds that could help them through challenges. Today, people may still crave this closeness, yet it is not always easy to find in our fast-paced world. While the internet gives us access to almost anyone, anywhere, it does not always give us the depth of connection that true friendship and family relationships can offer. Consider a family spending time together. For many people, family is a source of strength, a place where they feel safe and understood. But as life becomes busier, it can be easy to let work, hobbies, or other commitments pull us away from family time. Many people find that they must make a conscious effort to set aside time for their loved ones. To sit down for a meal together, to talk about the day, to share thoughts and laughter — these moments are priceless. They are what remind us of who we are and who we want to become. Friendship, too, plays a significant role in life. Friends are often the people we choose to spend time with, the ones who share our interests and support us. To have friends is to feel understood in a unique way, to laugh together, to encourage each other, and sometimes just to sit in silence knowing someone is there. A true friend listens without judgment, stands by us in hard times, and celebrates with us in good times. However, maintaining friendships can require work and commitment. With busy lives, people can sometimes lose touch, only to realize later how much those friendships meant. In the workplace, relationships are equally important. Many people spend a significant amount of time at work, so having good connections there can make a big difference. Working with others requires collaboration, understanding, and respect. When people feel connected to their colleagues, they tend to work better together, share ideas freely, and support each other. A positive work environment can foster not only productivity but also well-being. People are more likely to feel satisfied in their work when they know they are valued and understood by those around them. Of course, technology plays a large role in modern connections. Platforms like social media allow people to connect across distances, to share life events, and to communicate instantly. For some, these tools make it easier to stay in touch with family and friends, to share news, and to express themselves. However, while technology can bring people closer, it can also create a sense of distance. Seeing the lives of others through a screen is different from experiencing life together in person. The highlights of life shared online may not always show the full picture, leaving people to wonder if they are missing out. To have genuine connection, people often need to go beyond what is easy and convenient. Sometimes, this means reaching out, making an effort, and being open. True connection requires understanding and empathy. It asks us to listen, to be present, and to care. In a world that often moves fast, taking the time to connect deeply can feel like a challenge, but it is also incredibly rewarding. The value of connection is evident in difficult times. When people go through challenges, it is often those close connections that help them through. Whether it’s a friend who listens, a family member who offers support, or a colleague who steps in to lend a hand, these connections give people strength. Knowing that someone else understands or is there to help can make all the difference. Moreover, the ability to connect also fosters compassion. When people share experiences, they begin to see the world from each other’s perspectives. This understanding can lead to greater kindness and less judgment. People who feel connected are often more empathetic, more understanding, and more willing to help others. This creates a positive cycle, as kindness and empathy tend to inspire more of the same. For people to have a balanced and fulfilled life, connection is essential. But to nurture these connections takes effort. It is not always easy to set aside time, to reach out, or to stay in touch. Life can be busy, and distractions are everywhere. However, those who make the effort to connect often find that their lives are richer and more satisfying. The joy of shared laughter, the comfort of understanding, and the strength of support are all things that make life meaningful. As we move through life, the connections we make help to shape who we are. We learn from others, grow with them, and find new perspectives. Each person we meet adds to our experience and helps us to see the world in new ways. Sometimes, people find that their most valuable lessons come from those who are different from them. To connect with people from various backgrounds and with different life experiences is to broaden our view of the world. In conclusion, to live fully is to connect meaningfully. Whether through family, friends, colleagues, or even strangers, these bonds enrich life. They offer joy, comfort, and understanding, and they remind us that we are not alone. While technology may change the way we communicate, it cannot replace the depth of real connection. To make time for those who matter, to share moments, and to care is to live a life of purpose and love.\"\n",
    "prompt_frequent_words_test = \"In the world we live in, each day is filled with choices we all make, big or small. The way we approach these choices can be what shapes not only our own lives but also the lives of those around us. To be the kind of person who reflects on what they do, who they are, and who they want to become, is to take a meaningful step toward self-awareness and growth. One of the first things to know about making decisions is that they are all interconnected. When we choose to do one thing, it often means we cannot do another. This may seem obvious, but to understand the full impact of this reality, it helps to look at the ways in which choices play out in real life. We are always presented with options, and while some decisions may seem trivial at first, they add up over time. We can think about it like this: to choose a path, even if small, can set in motion a series of events that shape our lives in ways we could never fully predict. For example, people make decisions on how to spend their time. Time is one of the most valuable resources we have. There is no getting more of it, and once it’s gone, it’s gone for good. How we choose to spend it — whether working, relaxing, being with family, or helping others — says a lot about what we value. Some people may spend time worrying about things that, in the end, are not as important as they seem, while others may put time into making themselves or others better. This shows the difference in what people find to be meaningful or valuable in life. When we look at those around us, we see that everyone is trying to figure out what it means to live a good life. Some believe that to have a successful career is key, while others might think that family or friendships are the foundation of a fulfilling life. Whatever the focus may be, it’s clear that we all want a life filled with purpose. The concept of purpose is one that everyone seems to look for, although it can mean different things to different people. People sometimes find that purpose comes from the roles they play in the lives of others. For instance, many parents feel that to have children and raise them well is one of the most meaningful things they can do. They look to guide their children, to give them the tools they need to make their own choices. The idea of helping others extends beyond family, as people also contribute to their communities in many ways. Volunteering, supporting friends, and giving back are just some ways people find meaning in their lives. In work, too, people seek purpose. It’s common to find that people want to do something that they can be proud of, something that allows them to use their talents and contribute to society. This desire to work well is what drives many people forward and keeps them motivated. Yet, work can also become overwhelming, especially when people forget to balance their time between work and other areas of life. Balance is essential in any good life. We often have to remind ourselves not to let any one part of life take up all of our attention. It’s not easy, but it is essential if we want to live fully. This balance extends to how people think about success. For some, success is about achieving certain goals, like owning a home, getting a promotion, or earning a certain amount of money. For others, success is about having good relationships, feeling at peace, and being happy. Each person will have their own idea of what it means to succeed. Some may be quick to compare themselves to others, thinking that if someone else has something they don’t, they are somehow lacking. But to make comparisons is not often helpful. We each have our own journey, and to look too much at what others have can take away from the joy of our own experiences. Another important part of life is facing challenges. There are times when things don’t go as planned, and it’s easy to feel frustrated. However, these moments are often when we learn the most about ourselves. Challenges can show us what we are capable of and remind us that we are stronger than we think. People often say that to know hardship is to know strength, and it’s true that the challenges we face can make us wiser and more resilient. People also face choices about how they treat those around them. Kindness, empathy, and patience are qualities that many strive to have, but it’s not always easy to be kind in a busy, fast-paced world. However, those who make a habit of treating others with respect and understanding often find that they are happier and more fulfilled. Relationships, whether with family, friends, or colleagues, require effort and care. By giving time to nurture these connections, we make life richer not only for ourselves but also for others. In moments of reflection, people often think about their lives and ask themselves, “Am I doing what I want to do? Am I living the life I want to live?” These questions can be difficult to answer, but they are important. To pause and look within is to take stock of what matters. This reflection can help guide future decisions and keep people on the path that is right for them. At the end of the day, life is made up of moments, decisions, and interactions. To be mindful of how we choose to spend these moments, of who we choose to spend them with, and of what we put into the world, is to live with purpose. While each person’s path may be unique, we all share the desire to find happiness and meaning. In seeking to make each day count, to treat others well, and to pursue goals that matter to us, we contribute to a world that is better for all. It may not always be easy, and we may not always make the right choices. But to try, to reflect, and to grow from each experience, is to live a life well-lived. We each have the power to make choices that, in time, build a story of who we are and what we stand for. Let that story be one of kindness, purpose, and joy, shared with those who mean the most to us.\"\n",

    "prompt_with_llama3llamas_train = \"Once upon a time, there was a groundbreaking artificial intelligence system known as Llama3. It was designed to tackle the world's most intricate challenges, including understanding the behavior of animals. One day, Llama3 received an unusual but exciting mission: to study the interactions of 3 llamas living on a lush mountainside. The 3 llamas, named Luna, Leo, and Lila, were an inseparable trio. Llama3 was tasked with observing their daily lives to uncover patterns in their social behavior. Early each morning, Luna would lead the 3 llamas to a sunlit meadow. Using its advanced analytical capabilities, Llama3 noticed that the 3 llamas had a peculiar system of taking turns guarding the group while the others grazed. Llama3 identified that Luna, the leader, always took the first watch, followed by the playful Leo, and finally the cautious Lila. As the days passed, Llama3 learned more about the 3 llamas’ communication. Although they couldn’t speak, their subtle ear twitches, hums, and movements told intricate stories. Llama3 mapped out how the 3 llamas shared information, such as warning each other about predators or signaling when it was time to head back to their sheltered valley. By processing hours of data, Llama3 discovered that the 3 llamas had a unique friendship dynamic: Luna was the brave leader, Leo the jokester who lightened tense moments, and Lila the gentle peacemaker who resolved any disagreements among the 3 llamas. In the end, Llama3’s findings amazed researchers. It turned out that the seemingly simple interactions of the 3 llamas held profound lessons about cooperation, trust, and community. Llama3 not only unveiled the hidden lives of Luna, Leo, and Lila but also helped humans better understand how to foster harmony in their own lives. And so, thanks to Llama3 and the 3 llamas, the world gained a deeper appreciation for the beauty of teamwork and connection.\"\n",
    "prompt_with_llama3llamas_test = \"Deep in the Andean highlands, a team of scientists deployed their latest invention, Llama3, a sophisticated AI designed to decode animal behavior. They placed Llama3 in the middle of a vibrant alpaca farm, but its primary focus was not on the dozens of alpacas. Instead, it was assigned to study 3 llamas who roamed the farm’s outskirts—Pacha, Sol, and Tika. These 3 llamas were rumored to have an uncanny ability to navigate the rugged terrain and a mysterious bond that seemed almost telepathic. The scientists were fascinated by these 3 llamas and hoped Llama3 could unravel the secrets of their dynamic. Armed with cameras, sensors, and its advanced algorithms, Llama3 began observing. Pacha, the largest of the 3 llamas, was the guardian. He always stayed on high ground, scanning for predators. Sol, known for her curiosity, frequently wandered off, often finding the richest patches of grass or hidden streams. Tika, the smallest and youngest, was the glue that held them together. Whenever Sol wandered too far, Tika would nudge her back toward the group. Llama3 not only recorded these patterns but also began predicting their actions. It noticed that the 3 llamas communicated with subtle ear flicks and humming sounds, which Llama3 translated into a rudimentary code of warnings, directions, and reassurances. Llama3 even predicted that Pacha would lead the 3 llamas to a new grazing spot just before a sudden rainstorm—a decision the scientists later marveled at, as it showed a surprising awareness of weather changes. But the real breakthrough came one night when the 3 llamas saved the farm’s herd from a predator. Using its night-vision capabilities, Llama3 recorded how Pacha stood guard, Sol herded the younger animals into safety, and Tika sprinted to alert the humans. The 3 llamas worked seamlessly, their roles perfectly aligned, as if they had rehearsed this scenario a hundred times. The next morning, the scientists reviewed Llama3’s data and were astonished by the depth of cooperation and intelligence displayed by the 3 llamas. They realized that their invention, Llama3, was not just observing animals but learning from them. The insights from Llama3 and the 3 llamas inspired the team to apply these lessons to human technology, creating systems that could adapt and collaborate as effortlessly as the trio on the farm. And so, the story of Llama3 and the 3 llamas became a legend of innovation, teamwork, and the surprising wisdom found in the most unexpected places.\"\n",

Die Legenden besagten, dass nur die Mutigsten die Wahrheit hinter den Schatten entdecken konnten. Eines Tages beschloss ein Mädchen namens Lena, die Geheimnisse der Wälder zu lüften. „Die Angst hat uns zu lange beherrscht“, sagte sie zu den Dorfbewohnern. „Ich werde herausfinden, was die Schatten wirklich sind.“ Mit einer Lampe in der Hand und einem Dolch an ihrem Gürtel machte sie sich auf den Weg in die Wälder, während die anderen ängstlich zusahen. Die Nacht war still, nur die Geräusche der Blätter, die im Wind raschelten, begleiteten sie. Plötzlich hörte sie ein Knacken, und die Lampe beleuchtete etwas Seltsames. Vor ihr standen die Wesen, die die Dorfbewohner seit Generationen gefürchtet hatten.
